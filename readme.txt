Hospitals are complex institutions that involve the participation of a wide range of people, including doctors, nurses, staff, chemists, and patients. The range of tasks performed within hospitals is equally diverse and may include patient admissions, doctor's investigations, operations, diagnoses, bill payments, room services, medicine issuance, and much more. To effectively manage all of this data and ensure that healthcare providers can perform their jobs efficiently, hospital management systems have been developed.

The hospital management system is a database system that stores information about healthcare and assists healthcare providers in performing their jobs more effectively. This system is designed to manage all aspects of a hospital's operations, from patient care to billing and administrative tasks.

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a hospital management system that fulfils the following requirements:

Every hospital should have a patient registration system.
Every patient should book an appointment to see a doctor.
Each hospital will have doctors from different specialities.
Every patient should have a valid appointment ID to meet a doctor.
A patient should have a proper diagnosis for claim purposes.
A patient should have their age, contact details, gender, and address specified for diagnosis.
The hospital should maintain records of each patient.
The hospital should calculate charges and generate bills for each patient.
Each lab in the hospital should maintain lab reports for the patients.
